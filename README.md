Repo with sample code explaining the SOLID principles

- **Single Responsible Principle**

A class should have one and only one reason to change, meaning that a class should have only one job.

- **Open-Close Principle**

Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.

- **Liskov Substitution Principle**

Objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without breaking the application.

- **Interface Segregation Principle**

A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use, or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.

- **Dependency Inversion Principle**

High-level modules should depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. This helps decouple the high-level and low-level modules, making it easier to change the low-level ones without affecting the high-level ones.
